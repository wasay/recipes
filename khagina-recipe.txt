Ingredients:
 - 5 large eggs
 - 5 tablespoons flour
 - black pepper, to taste
 - 1⁄4 teaspoon ground coriander
 - 1⁄4 teaspoon cardamom
 - 1⁄4 teaspoon salt
 - 1⁄2 cup onion, finely chopped
 - 2 tablespoons parsley, finely chopped
 - 4 tablespoons yogurt
 - 3 tablespoons butter


Directions:
 1. Beat the eggs, gradually sprinkling in the chick-pea flour, then add all the remaining ingredients (except butter) and beat together thoroughly.
 2. Melt the butter in a 9-inch skillet and por the egg mixture into it.
 3. Cook over low heat, covered, until the eggs are set on top.
 4. Flip the omelet out onto a plate and slide it back into the pan on the other side.
 5. Cook it for a few minutes more, just enough to lightly brown the other side, then turn it out on a platter.
 6. Serve warm or at room temperature.
